# YGO-DeckCartBuilder

A little project for myself to practice webscraping. I have no intentioning of financial gain from this, just wanted a quick way to make the cheapest possible shopping cart for the decks I want to play.
Data is pulled from https://yugiohprices.com/

## Input:
Text File of cardnames.
## Output:
Text File for each cardname, with each card entry containing the vendor name, edition, rarity, condition, link-to-vendor-listing, and price.

## NOTE:
This does not take into account the number of copies of each card you want. This is just to mainly get the links to each vendor in a single place for ease of shopping-cart creation.
